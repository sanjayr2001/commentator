## ABSTRACT
With the rise of social media and publicly available data, opinion mining is more accessible than ever. It is valuable for content creators, companies and advertisers to gain insights into what users think and feel. Commentator (YouTube comment analysis using Natural Language Processing) examines comments on YouTube videos, and builds a Naive Bayes Classifier to automatically determine their sentiment. The Naive Bayes Classifier categorizes the sentiment into 6 categories of human emotions : Sad, Angry, Surprise, Fear, Happy and Love. The classification of comments into these categories expresses peopleâ€™s opinions more accurately rather than classifying it as positive or negative comments. Based on analysis done by the Commentator for a video, viewers also can understand the nature of the video and also can prevent watching that particular video if they are not interested. Commentator also can spot promotion done by the content creators or the inaccurate facts mentioned by the content creators through the analysis of the YouTube Video Comments.

## To Run

### 1. Open the Commentator - Multinomial Naive Bayes.ipynb file in Google Chrome

### 2. Upload the mod_train.txt, test.txt and train.txt files in Google Collab

### 3. Select Runtime->Run all or Ctrl+F9

### 4. Now enter the YouTube Video ID of the video for which analysis has to be done and press Enter

### 5. Run the remaining modules in Google Collab to extract the predicted results of the model and to calculate Performance Parameters
