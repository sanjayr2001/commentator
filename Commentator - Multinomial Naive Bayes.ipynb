Because making a diagnosis without examining a patient is unethical. But the doctor here was not making a diagnosis. What he was doing is to invoke his EXPERT WITNESS PRIVILEGE, which is, to give EXPERT OPINION (not diagnosis) ON EVENTS THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH A PSYCHIATRIC DISORDER, BASED ON MEDICAL RECORDS OF DEPP. The medical records of Depp WERE THE IMPLIED DIAGNOSIS.The doctor used MEDICAL RECORDS and other such VALID DATA ( not made by himself) to VERIFY THAT SUCH BEHAVIOR AS SHOWN IN THE DATA ARE CONSISTENT WITH A MENTAL DISORDER, WITHOUT HAVING TO DIAGNOSE. Depp&#39;s lawyer was the unethical one, trying to ERASE EXPERT WITNESSING SO HE COULD SAVE DEPP, while we all saw DEPP&#39;S LAWYERS ALSO USE EXPERT WITNESSES.
